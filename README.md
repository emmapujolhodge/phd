# PhD Research
R scripts and figures from my PhD research: using phylodynamics and mathematical modelling to investigate HIV-1 transmission in East African epidemics. Now focusing on **aim_1:** characterising HIV-1 infections from participants in the East Africa SEARCH trial. For now, my project has 4 aims:

1. Characterising HIV-1 infections in the East Africa SEARCH trial
2. Analysing HIV-1 transmission networks and cluster dynamics in the SEARCH trial
3. Comparative analysis of HIV-1 phylodynamics amongst different populations in East Africa
4. Modelling local transmission dynamics and intervention effects in the SEARCH population
